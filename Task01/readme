The given code consists of a simple Java socket programming example in which the client sends a request to the server and the server responds with the current date and time. Here's a documentation of the code:

Client.java
The Client.java file contains the client-side code of the socket programming example. The purpose of this code is to create a socket connection with the server and receive the current date and time from the server.

Main Function
The main function of the Client class performs the following steps:

Create a new Socket object with the hostname localhost and port number 7777.
Create an InputStreamReader object to read the input stream from the server.
Create a BufferedReader object to read the data from the input stream.
Read the response from the server using the readLine() method of the BufferedReader object.
Print the response to the console.
Close the socket connection.
Server.java
The Server.java file contains the server-side code of the socket programming example. The purpose of this code is to listen for incoming socket connections from the client and respond with the current date and time.

Main Function
The main function of the Server class performs the following steps:

Start an infinite loop to listen for incoming socket connections.
Create a new ServerSocket object with the port number 7777.
Print a message to the console indicating that the server is running.
Wait for a client to connect using the accept() method of the ServerSocket object.
Print a message to the console indicating that a client has connected.
Get the current date and time using the Date class.
Create a DataOutputStream object to write the data to the output stream.
Create a PrintWriter object to write the data to the output stream.
Write the current date and time to the output stream using the println() method of the PrintWriter object.
Close the ServerSocket object to stop listening for new connections.
Note that the server will keep running indefinitely until it is terminated manually.
